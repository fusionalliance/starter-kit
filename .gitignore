# GITIGNORE
# In order to keep remote repositories free of files specific to an
# individual's development environment, certain files should not be committed
# to the remote repository. We have attempted to define 2 categories of files:
# General Stuff and Language Specific. Within each category is a heading
# giving a clue to developers why a file/directory is ignored. Each rule under
# a heading should be in alphabetical order.
#

# === General Stuff ===
# System
